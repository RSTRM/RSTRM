The people there are either queer or queer-knowledgeable and will probably understand if you need to use a safe bathroom (though it is mad small, approx. the size of a small closet); you don't have to buy things. If you have a few minutes and/or a few dollars to spend, though, take a peek through the shelves!",

Single-user rooms; no key request needed. \r\n\r\nThough the restrooms are large enough to accommodate most manual wheelchairs, shop is crowded w tables, so getting to the restroom isn\'t easy & all appliances in there (sink, toilet) are "standard" (non-accessible).\r\n\r\nIn my experience, very queer & trans friendly safe place.',

      "most buildings on campus may be entered without ID; you can enter campus through with the main gate (corner of DeKalb Ave and Hall Street--there is a security booth, but they don't ask for ID during daytime) or through parking lot entrance on Willoughby.  Most campus buildings are open to public, with some containing gendered multi-use restrooms and some with single-use stalls (and a few formerly-gendered restrooms that students have made into all-gender).  Notably: library and Design Center and Higgins Hall check ID for entry. Also notable: accessible, all-gender single-use restroom in lower level of North Hall (wheelchair accessible from back of building).\r\n\r\nCampus atmosphere tends to be LGBTQIA+ friendly.",

But the CMA is a safe place that is very accepting of all people, and there are several elevators to make the whole building accessible. The museum has tons of great artwork and activities, and is an awesome place all around. So if you're ever visiting Columbus, make it a place to visit!",
